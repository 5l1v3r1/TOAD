#### Java Exercises (ArrayList and LinkedList)

Read about the ArrayList and LinkedList Classes of Java.
(1). Write a Java program that tests all important methods (two variants of add and remove methods, set, get, indexOf, contains methods) of ArrayList class. Test your program with user input and strings.

(2). Write a Java program that tests all important methods (addFirst, addLast, getFirst, getLast, lastIndexOf, pollFirst, pollLast, removeFirst, removeLast, removeFirstOccurrence, removeLastOccurrence, and set methods) of LinkedList class. Test your Program with user input and strings.

(3). Write a Java program to maintain the books in a library. Each book has a name, the author(s), total number of copies of the book, status of the book (which should show how many more copies of the book are available in the library). Write methods to add new books and remove books, to list all books with their details. Also, write methods to update the status of the book whenever a copy is borrowed by some user. In addition, for the books that have been borrowed by someone, your program should maintain information such as the name of the borrower, the ID of the borrower, the issue date, and the due date.

(4). Write a Java program that has a base class called Vehicle. Each Vehicle has two properties (private data members) registration number and number of wheels. Write methods to set and get these data members. Inherit three subclasses from this class to represent buses, cars, and three-wheelers. For each subclass find two unique properties and define data members to denote these properties, and also define methods to set and get these properties. Your program should make use the keywords this, and super.
